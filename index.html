    <h1>What is FGM or Female Genitalial Mutation?</h1>
    <p> The mutiliation of female genitalial organs can be characterized by the <strong>complete 
        removal</strong> of or <strong>partial cutting of external female gentialia</strong> for non-medical purposes. It is often performed 
        to force women to keep their <strong>virginity</strong> until marriage, and it comes with a host of
        problems, including urinary issues, vaginal issues, complications during childbirth 
        and worst of all, death.
